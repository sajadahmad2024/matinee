# Accessibility

Flutter accessibility auditing and remediation across WCAG 2.1 conformance levels A, AA, and AAA — semantics, touch targets, focus management, color contrast, text scaling, and motion sensitivity across mobile, desktop, and web platforms.

---

## Core Standards

Apply these standards to ALL accessibility work:

- **Begin every audit by asking the user which WCAG 2.1 conformance level they are targeting (A, AA, or AAA)** — never assume AA
- **Begin every audit by asking which platforms are targeted (mobile, desktop, web)** — screen reader behavior and keyboard requirements differ per platform
- **Every `Image` must have `semanticLabel` or be wrapped in `Semantics(label:)`** — decorative images use `excludeFromSemantics: true`
- **Never use `GestureDetector` for tap targets** — use `InkWell`, `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, or `IconButton`; `GestureDetector` is pointer-only and unreachable via keyboard or switch access
- **All interactive elements: 48x48 dp minimum touch target** — enforce with `SizedBox`, `ConstrainedBox`, or `padding`
- **Never use color as the sole differentiator** — always pair color with a label, icon, or shape
- **All animations must respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`** — gate every `AnimationController`, `AnimatedContainer`, and `Hero` transition on this flag
- **Icon-only buttons must have `Tooltip` or `Semantics(label:)`** — screen readers have no other way to convey purpose
- **Never use `ExcludeSemantics` on non-decorative content** — doing so hides meaningful information from assistive technology
- **Fixed-height containers must not wrap `Text`** — use `minHeight` constraints; fixed heights clip text at 1.5-2x font scale
- **All text and UI components must meet the contrast ratio for the selected WCAG level** — see the WCAG Level Criteria Reference section below for level-specific thresholds

---

## Workflow

Every accessibility engagement follows four phases in sequence. Do not skip Phase 1 or Phase 2.

### Phase 1 — Conformance Level Selection

Before auditing or writing any accessibility code, ask:

> "Which WCAG 2.1 conformance level are you targeting?
>
> - **A** — Removes the most critical barriers. Covers alt text, keyboard access, no seizure risks, basic structure, and error identification.
> - **AA** — Builds on Level A. Adds contrast ratios (4.5:1 / 3:1), captions, resize text, focus appearance, and consistent navigation. This is the most common legal and compliance standard.
> - **AAA** — Highest level. Adds enhanced contrast (7:1), sign language, extended audio descriptions, and no timing requirements. Full AAA is rarely required for entire products but may apply to specific components.
>
> Reply with A, AA, or AAA."

Record the selected level. All subsequent audit checks, report criteria references, and fix recommendations apply only the rules for that level (plus all levels below it).

### Phase 2 — Platform Selection

Ask:

> "Which platform(s) is this app targeting? Select all that apply:
>
> - **Mobile** — iOS (VoiceOver) and/or Android (TalkBack)
> - **Desktop** — macOS (VoiceOver), Windows (Narrator, NVDA, JAWS), Linux (Orca)
> - **Web** — browser-based; NVDA+Chrome (Windows), JAWS+Chrome (Windows), VoiceOver+Safari (macOS)
>
> Reply with one or more: Mobile, Desktop, Web."

Record selected platforms. Apply platform-specific checks during the audit:

- **Mobile** — touch target sizes (48x48 dp), TalkBack/VoiceOver semantic traversal order, gesture alternatives for all pointer-only interactions
- **Desktop** — full keyboard navigation required for every interaction, focus indicators always visible, no touch-only interactions
- **Web** — bypass blocks (2.4.1), page titles (2.4.2), language of page (3.1.1), reflow at 320px equivalent (1.4.10), hover/focus content persistence (1.4.13)

### Phase 3 — Level-Appropriate Audit

Audit the provided files or widgets across the following six categories, checking only criteria applicable to the selected level AND relevant to the selected platforms. For each finding, capture: file path and approximate line number, WCAG criterion ID and name, platform(s) affected, current behavior, expected behavior, Flutter fix (before/after code).

Audit categories (check all six in order):

1. **Semantics & Screen Reader** — labels, roles, live regions, merge/exclude semantics. Screen readers by platform: TalkBack (Android), VoiceOver (iOS/macOS), Narrator/NVDA/JAWS (Windows), Orca (Linux)
2. **Touch Target Sizes** — 48x48 dp minimum for all interactive elements (mobile-critical); on desktop/web, verify keyboard focus area is visible and sufficient
3. **Focus & Keyboard Navigation** — keyboard operability, traversal order, dialog focus trapping, focus indicators; critical for desktop and web; verify gesture fallbacks exist on mobile
4. **Color Contrast** — text and UI component ratios at the selected level's threshold (see the WCAG Level Criteria Reference section below)
5. **Text Scaling** — no fixed-height text containers, no clamped text scaling, overflow handling at 200% scale
6. **Animation & Motion** — `disableAnimations` gating on all `AnimationController`, `Hero`, and `AnimatedContainer` instances; no content flashing > 3 Hz

After completing all six categories, produce the Audit Report using the level-specific template in [references/audit-templates.md](references/audit-templates.md).

### Phase 4 — Remediation Scope Selection

After delivering the report, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with a single question:

```yaml
question: "The audit is complete. How would you like to proceed with fixes?"
header: "Fix scope"
options:
  - label: "All issues"
    description: "Fix every CRITICAL, MAJOR, and MINOR finding"
  - label: "Critical + Major only"
    description: "Fix blockers and significant barriers; skip MINOR polish items"
  - label: "Critical only"
    description: "Fix only what blocks assistive technology users entirely"
  - label: "Specific findings"
    description: "List the finding numbers you want fixed"
```

Apply exactly the fixes the user selects. After applying fixes, confirm: "Fixed [N] findings ([severities]). [N remaining] remain open."

## WCAG Level Criteria Reference

Use this table during Phase 3 to determine which criteria apply at the selected level. Level AA includes all Level A criteria. Level AAA includes all Level A and AA criteria.

### Level A — Core Criteria

| WCAG ID | Criterion | Flutter Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 | Non-text Content | `semanticLabel` on images; `Semantics(label:)` on icons; `excludeFromSemantics: true` on decorative |

## Semantics & Screen Reader

Flutter's `Semantics` widget communicates widget purpose to screen readers (TalkBack on Android, VoiceOver on iOS and macOS, Narrator/NVDA/JAWS on Windows, Orca on Linux).

**Anti-patterns — missing or wrong semantic labels:**

```dart
// WRONG — Empty semanticLabel on meaningful content
Image.asset('assets/warning_icon.png', semanticLabel: '') // announces nothing

// WRONG — No semanticLabel on informative image
Image.asset('assets/chart.png') // screen reader skips or announces filename
```

**Anti-pattern — excluding meaningful content:**

```dart
// WRONG — Hides actionable content from assistive technology
ExcludeSemantics(
  child: ElevatedButton(onPressed: _submit, child: const Text('Submit')),
)
```

**Live regions** — dynamic content that updates without interaction must announce changes:

```dart
Semantics(liveRegion: true, child: Text('$itemCount items in cart'))
SemanticsService.announce('Upload complete', TextDirection.ltr);
```

---

## Touch Target Sizes

All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target of 48x48 dp (WCAG 2.5.5).

**Anti-pattern — touch target too small:**

```dart
// WRONG — Touch target is 24x24, below 48dp minimum
SizedBox(
  width: 24,
  height: 24,
  child: GestureDetector(
    onTap: _onTap,
    child: const Icon(Icons.close, size: 24),
  ),
)
```

Use `SizedBox(width: 48, height: 48)`, `ConstrainedBox(minWidth: 48, minHeight: 48)`, or `Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(12))` around small icons.

---

## Focus & Keyboard Navigation

Every interactive widget must be reachable via keyboard and switch access (WCAG 2.1.1, 2.1.2). Use `FocusTraversalGroup` + `OrderedTraversalPolicy` when the default tab order does not match the visual reading order. `showDialog` and `showModalBottomSheet` handle focus trapping and restoration automatically.

**Anti-pattern — keyboard-inaccessible tap handler:**

```dart
// WRONG — GestureDetector is not keyboard-accessible
GestureDetector(onTap: _onTap, child: const Text('Click me'))

// CORRECT — InkWell is focusable and keyboard-accessible
InkWell(onTap: _onTap, child: const Text('Click me'))
```

Custom focus indicators must meet 3:1 contrast (WCAG 2.4.11 AA); at AAA (2.4.12), indicator must be ≥ 2px and enclose the component.

---

## Color Contrast

Contrast requirements start at Level AA — Level A has no contrast requirement.

| Element | Level AA | Level AAA | WCAG criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal text (< 18pt / < 14pt bold) | 4.5:1 | 7:1 | 1.4.3 / 1.4.6 |
| Large text (>= 18pt / >= 14pt bold) | 3:1 | 4.5:1 | 1.4.3 / 1.4.6 |
| UI components and focus indicators | 3:1 | 3:1 | 1.4.11 |

Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` tokens for consistent contrast. `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` (see **Material Theming** skill) automatically generates accessible color pairings for all Material roles.

**Anti-patterns:**

```dart
// WRONG — Light gray on white fails 4.5:1
Text('Status: Active', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey.shade300))

// WRONG — Color as sole differentiator
Container(color: isValid ? Colors.green : Colors.red) // no label or icon
```

---

## Text Scaling

Widgets must accommodate user font-size preferences up to 2x scale without clipping (WCAG 1.4.4).

**Anti-pattern — fixed height around text:**

```dart
// WRONG — Fixed height clips text at large scale
SizedBox(height: 48, child: Text('This text will be clipped at 1.5x font scale'))
```

**Anti-pattern — clamping text scale:**

```dart
// WRONG — Overrides user accessibility preferences
MediaQuery(
  data: MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith(textScaler: TextScaler.noScaling),
  child: const Text('Ignoring user font preferences'),
)
```

Use `ConstrainedBox(constraints: BoxConstraints(minHeight: 48))` around text containers.

---

## Animation & Motion

All animations must respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` (WCAG 2.3.3). No content may flash > 3 Hz (WCAG 2.3.1).

**Anti-pattern — ignoring reduced-motion preference:**

```dart
// WRONG — Animation always plays regardless of user preference
AnimatedContainer(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  color: _isActive ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey,
  child: child,
)

// CORRECT — Gate on disableAnimations (use selective method, not .of())
AnimatedContainer(
  duration: MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf(context)
      ? Duration.zero
      : const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  color: _isActive ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey,
  child: child,
)
```
